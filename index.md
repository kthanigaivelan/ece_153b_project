# ECE 153B - Energy Efficient Lighting

Archana Neupane & Krithika Thanigaivelan

### Overview/Goal/Purpose:
We would like to create a energy efficient lighting system, that will only draw as much power as is absolutely needed. To do this, we will implement a light sensor, which will monitor the ambient light of the space and make adjustments in the LED brightness to maintain a standard level of overall brightness in the space. A secondary goal to further conserve energy is to implement motion or infrared based triggering, so the light only turns on once there is someone in the vicinity, and turns off once they leave.
