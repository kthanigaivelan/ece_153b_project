# ECE 153B - Energy Efficient Lighting

### Overview/Goal/Purpose:
We would like to create a energy efficient lighting system, that will only draw as much power as is absolutely needed. To do this, we will implement a light sensor, which will monitor the ambient light of the space and make adjustments in the LED brightness to maintain a standard level of overall brightness in the space. A secondary goal to further conserve energy is to implement motion or infrared based triggering, so the light only turns on once there is someone in the vicinity, and turns off once they leave.

### Peripherals
- LED/smart lamp or dimmer switch: LIFX a19 smart bulb>
- light sensor: adafruit bh1750
- optional motion/infrared sensor: onyehn infrared pir motion sensor detector

### Serial Interfaces
- I2C (Light sensor)
- UART (bluetooth light bulb)

## Using Github pages (reference)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kthanigaivelan/ece_153b_project/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kthanigaivelan/ece_153b_project/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
